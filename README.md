## Airbnb Price Prediction Project

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing detailed information about Airbnb listings from various countries. The goal is to predict the price of listings using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/airbnb-dataset)
- **Features Include:**
  - **rating:** Average rating of the listing
  - **reviews:** Number of reviews received
  - **price:** Price per night
  - **country:** Country where the listing is located
  - **bathrooms:** Number of bathrooms
  - **guests:** Number of guests the listing can accommodate
  - **bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms
  - **studios:** Number of studio units

### Objectives

- Predict Airbnb listing prices using a regression model.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing price.
- Apply machine learning methods for model development and optimization.

### Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
   - Handled null values and converted categorical data into numerical formats.
   - Selected and engineered relevant features for modeling.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Implemented regression methods, with a focus on AdaBoost.
   - Optimized model performance using Grid Search.

### Real-World Applications

- **Dynamic Pricing for Hosts:** Helps hosts set competitive prices based on demand and seasonality.
- **Travel Planning:** Assists travelers and agencies in finding cost-effective booking times.

### Data Limitations

- Some features may not be strongly correlated with price, affecting model accuracy.
- This project provided valuable experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
